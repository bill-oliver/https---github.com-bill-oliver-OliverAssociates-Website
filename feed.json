As Canadians we would quickly come enjoy potentially healthier lives, expect new levels of comfort and convenience, with a broader, safer, more diverse and enjoyable diet. </p>\n<p>Canadians would quickly come to think of their day differently, for the day would be defined and punctuated in different ways than ever before, as a result of the introduction of modern, electric, household appliances, of which refrigerators, freezers and room air conditioners would be a central part, by the mid 20th century </p>\n<p>J. M Larsen produced a manually operated household refrigerator of sorts in 1913, but it was not until 1918 that the Kelvinator Company marketed the first automatic, unitary refrigerator for the home. In that year, it is reported to have sold sixty-seven machines. (See Note 1) The historic artifacts in Group 1.00, Unitary Equipment, including significant samplings the early work of Kelvinator of Canada, provide a rare view of the evolution of unitary refrigeration and air conditioning applications, as they evolved in Canada in the first half of the 20th century. </p>\n<p>For those formative years, the artifacts in this Group, 1.00,  are typical of the offerings of the Canadian refrigeration and air conditioning industry. They personified the applications found in the homes, farms and commercial premises of the period for, those that could afford life’s new amenities of comfort, convenience and privilege. </p>\n<p>This Specimen: This machine symbolises a unique period in the development of the industry. It was part of the first growth period of the household refrigerator as a mass consumer good, moving beyond the embryonic years and the exclusive appeal to the elite market ‘ once believed to be the only market. A second significant growth period would follow the pent up consumer demand of the late 1940’s a consequence of the Second World War. At that time, it was a first-time buyer’s market without trade-ins to be contended with. But for now the industry was targeting the first time buyer of modest means. It was a ‘refrigerator in every kitchen marketing’ ‘ following the lead of ther auto industry.</p>\n<h5 id=\"industrial-significance\">Industrial Significance:</h5>\n<p>By the early 1930’s it was realized that the much hoped for growth period of the industry, like that of the automobile industry, would come not from the manufacture and sale of high-end products, but also through the production of much more popularly affordable machines for middle class consumption, ones configured much better for the kitchens of the nation. - This refrigerator represents the early 1930’s market response to ‘the refrigerator in every kitchen’ movement, paralleling the ‘automobile in every garage’ movement of the times. It was originally priced at a low of $216.00 (See Ref. 1.2, Section 2, Form, C4916AA, price list dated Feb. 1 1935), for a replacement price in 1996 dollars of $2,650 - yet still a very sizeable investment for most households.</p>\n<h5 id=\"socio-economic-significance\">Socio-economic Significance:</h5>\n<p>It was a period of rapid technological change, with new materials, manufacturing methods, as well as new innovations in the design and development of compressors, evaporator and condensing systems, flow controls and electric motors all contributing to quieter, more efficient and better performing machines. </p>\n<p>It was also a period in which the economics and ethics of the times, as well as engineering practices in system design and construction, readily supported technological change with out creating undue obsolescence. The ‘open systems’ of the early 1930’s allowed for changes to new refrigerants as they were introduced ( This machine was converted from original S02 to CH3CL to F12), to new style evaporators and flow control systems, as well as to new quieter, and efficient electric motors.</p>\n<p>Kelvinator promoted its ‘modernization and revamp program’ (See Ref. 1.8, Bulletin No. 35-108. Sept. 1935) providing the engineering support needed for its dealers and the service industry. As a result any of these sturdy (400 lb.) machines were in operation well into the 1950’s, some, such as this specimen, surviving well into the 1960’s, having gone through many retrofits, lives and owners.</p>\n<h5 id=\"socio-cultural-significance\">Socio-cultural Significance:</h5>\n<h5 id=\"donor\">Donor:</h5>\n<p>G.

It would be difficult to have anticipated that by the end of the century few homes in the urban areas of southern Ontario would be built without central summer air conditioning. </p>\n<p>The window air conditioner was thus a harbinger, an early market indicator of what was to come. The single room, through the window air conditioner, was an essential part of the first wave of air conditioning engineering for the home, allowing the industry to develop the equipment design, application protocols and standards and test the interest of the market place for what might follow.</p>\n<h5 id=\"consumer-acceptance\">Consumer Acceptance:</h5>\n<h5 id=\"merchandising\">Merchandising:</h5>\n<h5 id=\"market-price\">Market Price:</h5>\n<h5 id=\"technological-significance\">Technological Significance:</h5>\n<p>Unitary Refrigeration Equipment: The idea of a unitary piece of refrigeration or air conditioning equipment was a significant one in its own right, one that had to wait its time.

The industry would quickly adapting what had been learned in the design of reliable hermetic compressors and coiling for the food industry to high heat transfer systems required for household air conditioning applications.</p>\n<p>Suddenly the refrigeration and air conditioning industry expanded dramatically with a number of new non-traditional players designing, manufacturing and marketing equipment for household and commercial applications.

Many manufactures, such as GE made one model adaptable for both through-the-window and wall applications.</p>\n<h5 id=\"consumer-acceptance\">Consumer Acceptance:</h5>\n<h5 id=\"merchandising\">Merchandising:</h5>\n<p>The market competition for room air conditioners was fierce, with a small select market to draw on manufacturers were looking to features to promote their products and increase market share, many of little real functional value to the owner.

The air freshener capsule provided by GE was such a sales gimmick.</p>\n<h5 id=\"market-price\">Market Price:</h5>\n<p>Original prise tag shows marked down price of $179.50, well below list prices for the period.</p>\n<h5 id=\"technological-significance\">Technological Significance:</h5>\n<p>Unitary Refrigeration Equipment: The idea of a unitary piece of refrigeration or air conditioning equipment was a significant one in its own right, one that had to wait its time. The scientists, engineers and inventors in the early years of the 20th century were intrigued and obsessed with the power of the technology and of its possible market potential. What they saw was the newly discovered principles of physics and heat engines - following, for example, the early works of Carnot, Faraday, Kelvin, and the later work of Perkins, Larsen and Carrier, to name a few. </p>\n<p>They understood the promise of the technology for the public good, not to say its consumer sales potential. Early engineering work advanced on a multiple fronts with development of compressors, heat exchangers, valves and piping variously strung together in configurations that would be found to work, but only after much experimentation.</p>\n<p>The arrival of unitary equipment, all those parts organised into a single whole, a single unit of construction, a ‘black box’, that could be offered to the consumer market was a significant technological and cultural event. Technologically the refrigerator would need to be seen to be safe, reliable, maintainable and useful. As well, in order to attract the development capital needed, it must be seen as potentially saleable and affordable, contributing to life’s needs and desires. Its socio- cultural and economic significance was marked, for it would change much. As Canadians we would quickly come enjoy potentially healthier lives, expect new levels of comfort and convenience, with a broader, safer, more diverse and enjoyable diet. </p>\n<p>As a result, Canadians would quickly come to think of their day differently, for the day would be defined and punctuated in different ways than ever before, as a result of the introduction of modern, electric, household appliances, of which refrigerators, freezers and room air conditioners would be a central part, by the mid 20th century </p>\n<p>J. M Larsen produced a manually operated household refrigerator of sorts in 1913, but it was not until 1918 that the Kelvinator Company marketed the first automatic, unitary refrigerator for the home.

In the public mind, however, the useful work was more simply that of cooling. </p>\n<p>This lead astute manufactures to popularise the use of the term ‘cooling unit’ in place of evaporator. It was the term adopted by the industry in the early years, as it attempted to connect with the human experience of the times to better promote its wares, gaining market share in the embryonic years of Canada’s emerging consumer society. (See examples in early sale literature from the Kelvinator Co. of Canada) </p>\n<p>Human experience and the social culture of the 1920’s also associated useful cooling with the melting of ice. Historically manufactures successfully played to this sense of public understanding by further marketing cooling units as icemakers. By this means they appealed to wide spread cultural understandings of how things got cooled, through the controlled melting of ice (the popular Canadian icebox of the 1920’s and 30’s). In a peculiar twist, it was often the job of the refrigeration sales or service man to explain to the homemaker that it was not really the ice in the ice cube trays that cooled the refrigerator, but the motor and compressor underneath. </p>\n<p>In the 1920’s manufactures of mechanical refrigerators for the home appealed to the consumer public by promoting ice and ice cream as the new consumables, the new food sensations available for all those sufficiently affluent to enjoy the experience. Promotional literature focused on the pleasant sensation of ice cold beverages and on ice cream making at home ‘ using the latest cooling unit. A recipe and food life style book came with the refrigerator for the edification and instruction of the homemaker (See examples in early sale literature from the Kelvinator Co. of Canada). Ice and ice cream making in the home was, in fact, one of the significant, new ‘Gee whiz’, household technologies of the times. </p>\n<p>This specimen is a particularly early, a well-preserved sample of cooling unit art form (Frigidaire shows this evaporator as discontinued May 5, 1928). Crude in manufacturing techniques, by subsequent standards, the industry would move quickly to modernise the look of its products and to develop the materials and manufacturing processes needed to produce them.

The size and weight of the self-contained, steel framed condensing unit with slow speed, two cylinder compressor and open, belt drive represents the end of a generation of such machines in the kitchens of the Nation. Their weight, size and noise would shortly be all greatly reduced with the introduction of smaller, quieter hermetically sealed refrigeration systems. </p>\n<p>The use of noxious refrigerants would also soon disappear, giving the electric refrigerator a greatly improved public image among Canadian householders. The heat transfer surfaces employed here by Frigidaire are unique to the period. For both condenser and evaporator surfaces the manufacturer has not made use of any secondary heat transfer surfaces, neither in the form of plates nor fins. </p>\n<p>The results, in both instances, are relatively inefficient extended primary surfaces, which add considerably to the bulk and weight of the refrigerator. The introduction of more efficient heat transfer surface materials and fabrication techniques would shortly contribute to smaller more efficient refrigeration systems for household use.</p>\n<h5 id=\"special-features\">Special Features:</h5>\n<h5 id=\"accessories\">Accessories:</h5>\n<p>:</p>\n<h5 id=\"capacities\">Capacities:</h5>\n<h5 id=\"performance-characteristics\">Performance Characteristics:</h5>\n<h5 id=\"operation\">Operation:</h5>\n<h5 id=\"control-and-regulation\">Control and Regulation:</h5>\n<h5 id=\"targeted-market-segment\">Targeted Market Segment:</h5>\n<p>The refrigerator stands as an icon of upper class social distinction, tastes and the life styles of the 1920’s in Canada.

The scientists, engineers and inventors in the early years of the 20th century were intrigued and obsessed with the power of the technology and of its possible market potential. What they saw was the newly discovered principles of physics and heat engines - following, for example, the early works of Carnot, Faraday, Kelvin, and the later work of Perkins, Larsen and Carrier, to name a few. </p>\n<p>They understood the promise of the technology for the public good, not to say its consumer sales potential. Early engineering work advanced on a multiple fronts with development of compressors, heat exchangers, valves and piping variously strung together in configurations that would be found to work, but only after much experimentation.</p>\n<p>The arrival of unitary equipment, all those parts organised into a single whole, a single unit of construction, a ‘black box’, that could be offered to the consumer market was a significant technological and cultural event. Technologically the refrigerator would need to be seen to be safe, reliable, maintainable and useful. As well, in order to attract the development capital needed, it must be seen as potentially saleable and affordable, contributing to life’s needs and desires. Its socio- cultural and economic significance was marked, for it would change much. As Canadians we would quickly come enjoy potentially healthier lives, expect new levels of comfort and convenience, with a broader, safer, more diverse and enjoyable diet. </p>\n<p>As a result, Canadians would quickly come to think of their day differently, for the day would be defined and punctuated in different ways than ever before, as a result of the introduction of modern, electric, household appliances, of which refrigerators, freezers and room air conditioners would be a central part, by the mid 20th century </p>\n<p>J. M Larsen produced a manually operated household refrigerator of sorts in 1913, but it was not until 1918 that the Kelvinator Company marketed the first automatic, unitary refrigerator for the home. In that year, it is reported to have sold sixty-seven machines. (See Note 1) The historic artifacts in Group 1.00, Unitary Equipment, including significant samplings the early work of Kelvinator of Canada, provide a rare view of the evolution of unitary refrigeration and air conditioning applications, as they evolved in Canada in the first half of the 20th century. </p>\n<p>For those formative years, the artifacts in this Group, 1.00, are typical of the offerings of the Canadian refrigeration and air conditioning industry. They personified the applications found in the homes, farms and commercial premises of the period for, those that could afford life’s new amenities of comfort, convenience and privilege. </p>\n<p>This Specimen, along with inventory item  No.008 help to profile the significant changes in the industry’s public offerings over a brief 2 years, from 1926 to 1928. The last half of the decade was a period remarkable styling, engineering and manufacturing innovation in the industry, inspired by the rapid market growth of the period. Included, as highlighted in contrasting the two specimens, are styling [square to round, modern corners of the Art deco], finish [yellowing paint to gleaming white porcelain], size and weight of condensing unit.</p>\n<h5 id=\"industrial-significance\">Industrial Significance:</h5>\n<h5 id=\"socio-economic-significance\">Socio-economic Significance:</h5>\n<p>This specimen stands as a cultural icon of upper class social distinction, tastes and the life styles of the 1920’s in Canada.

H. Oliver, Refrigeration and Electric Sales and Service, Aurora, Ontario, an early worker in the field of agricultural, commercial and consumer technology.</p>\n<h5 id=\"type-and-design\">Type and Design:</h5>\n<p>Similar to previous item, 015, this cooling unit is fabricated in formed and rolled steel sheet, to form refrigerant passages, with twin suction line accumulators, An advanced design concept for the mid 1930’s, it offered high heat transfer to meet new performance standards and new found consumer interests of the time. The movement to more integrated and smoothly articulated functional units (evaporators), made up of multiple, individual component parts, each with a life and purpose of its own, is evident.  </p>\n<p>The stainless steel fast freezing shelf was ahead of its times, as well as being ahead of the manufacturing and materials know-how of the period. The cooling unit was subject to rapid deterioration due to corrosion of dissimilarmaterials, as this specimen illustrates. </p>\n<p>What is new here, however, is also the horizontal pattern adopted by the coling unit, for central mounting on the top of the refrigerator (See picture from original manufacturers literature appended). The trend to larger cooling units, accommodating the consumer’s interest in frozen foods, was about to significantly alter the way cooling units (evaporators) would be configured in the future. </p>\n<p>The cooling unit would grow in size, spreading across the top of the refrigerator, until it occupied the full width of the cabinet and then move downwards to take over an ever increasing percentage of the refrigerated space.</p>\n<h5 id=\"construction\">Construction:</h5>\n<p>A significant aspect of the movement to more integrated and smoothly articulated engineering component design, is coming to see fully functioning components more holistically. Here the cooling unit, originally conceived as a box for ice cubes, with coils of copper tubing wrapped around it, has been re-conceptualised as a single operating entity. Box and coil are now one.</p>\n<h5 id=\"material\">Material:</h5>\n<h5 id=\"special-features\">Special Features:</h5>\n<p>Gleaming white porcelain finish; full back cooling unit with door in brushed aluminium ( a new designer material of the mid 30’s) with a classic design idiom.</p>\n<h5 id=\"accessories\">Accessories:</h5>\n<p>: \nRanco remote bulb temperature control, with automatic defrosts switch and manual reset motor overload protector- revolutionary for the times.</p>\n<p>Suction line check valve for high-side float operation.

The system was designed to reduce the bulk of refrigerant tubing connectors and improve the reliability of refrigerant piping.  </p>\n<p>Note the natural rubber mounting grommets in designer white, an appeal to a new style conscious public, as the household refrigerator was moved up the social ladder.</p>\n<h5 id=\"capacities\">Capacities:</h5>\n<h5 id=\"performance-characteristics\">Performance Characteristics:</h5>\n<p>The effects of corrosion on the suction line header, resulting from the porcelain on steel construction is evident, leading often to premature failure.</p>\n<h5 id=\"operation\">Operation:</h5>\n<h5 id=\"control-and-regulation\">Control and Regulation:</h5>\n<h5 id=\"targeted-market-segment\">Targeted Market Segment:</h5>\n<h5 id=\"consumer-acceptance\">Consumer Acceptance:</h5>\n<h5 id=\"merchandising\">Merchandising:</h5>\n<h5 id=\"market-price\">Market Price:</h5>\n<h5 id=\"technological-significance\">Technological Significance:</h5>\n<p>See Technological Significance documentation for THOC-HVACR 014 and 015. Like specimens 014 and 015, this historical artifact of the Canadian HVACR industry is a remarkable icon of its time, marking a dramatic change in engineering, concepts, manufacturing and styling, as the industry geared up to move well beyond its embryonic development years of the 1920’s. </p>\n<p>Of special note is the level of automation and refrigeration system regulation reflected here, in remote bulb temperature controlling, defrost control and motor over load protection (See also historical artifacts THOC-HVACR Group 7.00 ). Seen here are the early manifestations of engineering thought in the practical application of what would become the cybernetic revolution of the 40’s and 50’s, in which mechanical and electrical systems were conceived as purposeful, self-regulating and self-directing entities.</p>\n<p>Here, too, the unprepared public would be faced, most for the first time, with a myriad of switches and buttons (three), arrayed on a control panel (not included), which they were expected to understand and use effectively ‘ most did not. The local refrigeration salesman and serviceman, the support network of the times, were constantly on call, if  the householder found melted ice-cream, and other dripping contents on opening the refrigerator.</p>\n<p>Here, then, are the early manifestations, realised in the engineering concepts and hardware of the period, of the on-coming revolution in the processing of meaningful, purposeful, information through feedback loops. (See ‘Modern Systems Research for the Behavioral Scientist, W. Buckley, 1968)         .</p>\n<h5 id=\"industrial-significance\">Industrial Significance:</h5>\n<p>This offering was a significant attempt by Kelvinator and the Canadian refrigeration industry to improve system cooling and thermodynamic efficiencies, reduce manufacturing costs and progressively automate and regulate their systems better. The industry was investing heavily in new materials, construction and manufacturing technologies, in order to capture the interests of a second market buyers market.</p>\n<h5 id=\"socio-economic-significance\">Socio-economic Significance:</h5>\n<h5 id=\"socio-cultural-significance\">Socio-cultural Significance:</h5>\n<p>The trend to the ‘gentrification’ of the refrigerator and the kitchens of the nation was on its way, with the appeal to a new generation of urban design tastes, as reflected for example in the cooling unit’s designer door. The trend to gentrification would role on, unabated to the end of the century and beyond.</p>\n<h5 id=\"donor\">Donor:</h5>\n<p>G. Leslie Oliver, The T. H.

Located on the north slopes of the Oak Ridges Moraine, within 20 miles of Toronto, the County would also attract early ex-urban development, to be come a wealthy market place for the emerging household and consumer technologies of the early and mid 20th century. </p>\n<p>This artifact was discovered in the 1950’s in the used stock of T. H. Oliver, Refrigeration and Electric Sales and Service, Aurora, Ontario, an early worker in the field of agricultural, commercial and consumer technology.</p>\n<h5 id=\"type-and-design\">Type and Design:</h5>\n<p>The evaporator was engineered by Air Coils for the general replacement market of the post World War II years. Full equipped and loaded with features for the period, it included the latest remote bulb tempertaure control technology of the times. </p>\n<p>It employs an early engineering approach to aluminium evaporator construction. Coiled copper tubing is sandwiched between high conductivity aluminium plates to form the top, bottom and shelf of this 2 tray, ice making, evaporator. The cabinet is of formed and riveted in aluminium sheet stock with 1” fins at 1” centres on the two sidewalls.</p>\n<h5 id=\"construction\">Construction:</h5>\n<p>This simple approach to fabrication set aside, for the moment, the major problem to be overcome in the engineering of aluminium evaporators. The challenge was to develop robust bonding techniques required for pressure tight connections between copper and aluminium. In 1946 these techniques were yet to be perfected. The repair of leaks in aluminium evaporators would remain a challenge for the industry. The early aluminium stock was also soft and easily punctured.</p>\n<h5 id=\"material\">Material:</h5>\n<h5 id=\"special-features\">Special Features:</h5>\n<h5 id=\"accessories\">Accessories:</h5>\n<h5 id=\"capacities\">Capacities:</h5>\n<h5 id=\"performance-characteristics\">Performance Characteristics:</h5>\n<h5 id=\"operation\">Operation:</h5>\n<h5 id=\"control-and-regulation\">Control and Regulation:</h5>\n<h5 id=\"targeted-market-segment\">Targeted Market Segment:</h5>\n<p>The replacement market of the post World War II years was substantial. Not only due to the scarcities of wartime, but also the significant improvements in technology, and the Canadian consumer’s desire to modernise.</p>\n<h5 id=\"consumer-acceptance\">Consumer Acceptance:</h5>\n<h5 id=\"merchandising\">Merchandising:</h5>\n<h5 id=\"market-price\">Market Price:</h5>\n<h5 id=\"technological-significance\">Technological Significance:</h5>\n<p>The significance of this specimen, like 019, rests in its evolutionary context. It is part of the dynamic, rapidly changing pattern of developmental events that saw the Canadian refrigeration industry move beyond its crude, early offerings to the households of the nation and do so in a period of much less than two decades.  </p>\n<p>Of special significance, technologically, is the dramatic tansition from the  crude designs of the 1920’s and 30’sto those of the 40’s enabled by new materials science and newly informed engineering theory and practice.    .</p>\n<h5 id=\"industrial-significance\">Industrial Significance:</h5>\n<h5 id=\"socio-economic-significance\">Socio-economic Significance:</h5>\n<h5 id=\"socio-cultural-significance\">Socio-cultural Significance:</h5>\n<p>What is dramatised, here, is the social and cultural commitment of the period to up-grade, repair and maintain, rather than replace. While a function of the supply market of the day,  more importantly the behaviour pattern reflected the core, prevailing value system of Canadians - their respect for thrift and getting by. These core values would, however,  change dramatically over the next decade, as a result Canada’s consumer society about burst on the scene with explosive force.  .</p>\n<h5 id=\"donor\">Donor:</h5>\n<p>G.
